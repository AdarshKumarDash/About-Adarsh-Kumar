        Also I take care my two lovely birds named Bunty and Bubbly .One day I was giving them food, they suddenly flew away that day was my saddest day, my dad decided to bring two more birds named chunu and munu at that time whenever I see my new birds I always remember my old birds. One interesting thing is that after some months chumu lay 12 eggs but 6 eggs are broken, the chick did not come, so now I am waiting for these 6 eggs and I pray that chicks will come out from those eggsüôè.</p>
